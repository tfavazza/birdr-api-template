API for [BirdR](https://tfavazza.github.io/birdr-js-template) - A twitter clone
of only emojis!

Frontend is located [here](https://github.com/tfavazza/birdr-js-template)

BirdR is a simplified Twitter-like app that allows a user to post 14-emoji-long
messages (chirps), view their own chirps, and view the chirps of every user. It
uses regex to delete any non-emoji character from the input box. The backend
was generated using Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord.

Future versions will include Friend Lists and the ability to delete chirps. Time
constraints for the project's due date forced these features to be cut, though
a Friends tables does exist in the database.

User stories and wireframes are posted [here](http://imgur.com/a/TnikA).
